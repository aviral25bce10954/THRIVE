              Stress is your body and mind&apos;s natural reaction to a demand,
              challenge or change. A little stress can sometimes help you
              prepare and respond. The difficult part is when stress becomes
              very intense, happens repeatedly or does not seem to ease.

                Thrive is here to help you understand and manage everyday
                stress with practical, educational information. It is not a
                diagnosis and is not a substitute for professional care.
                Everyone&apos;s experience of stress is different. Self-help
                strategies can be useful, but if stress feels bigger than you
                can manage on your own, reaching out to a counsellor, doctor,
                trusted professional or another appropriate source of support
                is a strong and sensible step.
